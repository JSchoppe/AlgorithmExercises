# Algorithm Exercises
Contains examples of algorithms in C# with explanations on their runtime and storage efficiency. This repository holds the work completed for PROG-366 Algorithms at Columbia College Chicago in 2020.
## Contents
1. Simple algorithms with comments explaining their big O notation
2. Implementation of Algorithms (Library):
    - Fisher Yates Shuffle
## Course Content Overview
### Week 1
We discussed the basics of big-O, big-θ, and big-Ω. Examples were shown of basic collection insertion and retrieval algorithms with an overview of recursion vs looping. We discussed what it meant to reduce an algorithms into simpler problems and how this effects the big notations.
### Week 2
Further discussed how to analyze algorithms and reviewed various comparisons of common approaches to programming problems. We talked about the importance of considering the use case of each algorithm as it relates to its space and time efficiency.
### Week 3
Discussed the use of logarithms as well as Sigma(Big Sum) notation to describe iterative problems. Discussed the concept of divide and conquer where bigger problems can be systematically broken down into smaller problems that are easier to solve.
### Week 4
Discussed the use of randomization in algorithms, as well as the benefits and costs of true random vs predetermined random generators. We implemented these ideas in an implementation of the Fisher Yates shuffle.
