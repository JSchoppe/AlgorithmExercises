## Course Content Overview
### Week 1
In the first week we discussed the basics of big-O, big-θ, and big-Ω. Examples were shown of basic collection insertion and retrieval algorithms with an overview of recursion vs looping. We discussed what it meant to reduce an algorithms into simpler problems and how this effects the big notations.
