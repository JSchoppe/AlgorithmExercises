### Week 1
We discussed the basics of big-O, big-θ, and big-Ω. Examples were shown of basic collection insertion and retrieval algorithms with an overview of recursion vs looping. We discussed what it meant to reduce an algorithms into simpler problems and how this effects the big notations.
### Week 2
Further discussed how to analyze algorithms and reviewed various comparisons of common approaches to programming problems. We talked about the importance of considering the use case of each algorithm as it relates to its space and time efficiency.
### Week 3
Discussed the use of logarithms as well as Sigma(Big Sum) notation to describe iterative problems. Discussed the concept of divide and conquer where bigger problems can be systematically broken down into smaller problems that are easier to solve.
### Week 4
Discussed the use of randomization in algorithms, as well as the benefits and costs of true random vs predetermined random generators. We implemented these ideas in an implementation of the Fisher Yates shuffle.
### Week 5
Covered the use of prime numbers role in security, and the common algorithms used to calculate factors of a given number.
### Week 6
Went over the common collection types and their implementation in C#. Including Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
Discussed the tradeoffs of each collection type and scenarios where they are useful.
### Week 7
Discussed the implementation of Hash Table collections and the C# type-safe variant Dictionary. Went over issues with collision
and how a Hash Table can be fine tuned using parameters to trade off storage for speed.
### Week 8
Reviewed previous topics, improved and peer reviewed github repos.
